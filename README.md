# LevelSystem
Simple Discord Level System with a image creator similar to mee6


After you setup your bot you can use ,level command
Make sure you make a logs folder so that the console logs any errors/stuff you need to log


# Console.py
Instead of using print() use self.out() [in level.py] 
It is just a simple TUI. Type in stop to stop everything
